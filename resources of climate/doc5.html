</header>

<section>
    <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average temperature and weather patterns on Earth. It is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing the planet to warm.</p>
    <p>Natural factors such as volcanic eruptions and solar radiation can also contribute to climate variability; however, current climate changes are overwhelmingly linked to human activities.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Major Causes of Climate Change</h2>
    <p>The key contributors to climate change include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Human activities release carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), which contribute to the greenhouse effect. This effect leads to global warming as heat is trapped in the atmosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. When forests are cut down for agriculture or urban development, the stored carbon is released, further increasing atmospheric CO2 levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial Pollution:</strong> Factories emit large amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants during production processes, contributing to climate change.</li>
        <li><strong>Agricultural Practices:</strong> Certain farming methods, such as livestock production, release significant amounts of methane and nitrous oxide.</li>
        <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Landfills produce methane as organic waste decomposes. Proper waste management and recycling can reduce these emissions.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Impacts of Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Climate change affects natural and human systems in various ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rising Temperatures:</strong> Average global temperatures are increasing, leading to heatwaves and changing weather patterns.</li>
